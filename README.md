## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla JS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While I was doing this challenge I made sure to learn Flexbox and it helped me quite a lot to align the containers and items like I wanted. I learned a new html element called a `<dialog>` and I used that for the popup. 


```html
     <dialog id="dialog">
        <img src="images/illustration-thank-you.svg" />
        <h2>
          You selected
          <span id="rate"></span>
          out of five.
        </h2>
        <h1>Thank you!</h1>
        <p id="dialog_info">
          We appreciate you taking the time to give a rating. If you ever need
          more support, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch!
        </p>
      </dialog>
```

```css
    #dialog {
      width:clamp(22rem, 50%, 25rem);
      height:clamp(20rem, 70%, 25rem);
      background-color: var(--DarkBlue);
      position:relative;
      display: flex;
      justify-content:center;
      text-align: center;
      gap:5px;
      border:0;
      border-radius:10px;
      display:none;
      opacity:0;
      transition:0.7s;
    }
```

```js
  buttons.forEach((button) => {
        button.addEventListener('click', () => {
            number = button.innerHTML;
            const htmlText = `<span>${number}</span> `;
            ratediv.innerHTML = htmlText;

        });
    });
```

### Continued development

I am planning on learning Grid and continuing on to the junior challenges at frontend mentor soon. I am thinking of making my own little website for fun, but I'm not sure. I'll hopefully do it.

### Useful resources

- [popup modal by Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAB_v6yBXIE&t=436s&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - This helped me with the popup. I really found the `<dialog>` element interesting, because I could just add the popup content to a `<dialog>` element.
- 
- [ What the flexbox](https://www.flexbox.io) - This is an amazing tutorial which helped me finally understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
